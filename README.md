This project provides a simple clientâ€“server application for analyzing car images using the OpenAI API.  
It takes an image as input and returns a JSON response with ratings on **dirtiness**, **damage**, and a **final average rating**, along with a short explanation.

    "desc": "Car is moderately dirty, slightly damaged."
  }
